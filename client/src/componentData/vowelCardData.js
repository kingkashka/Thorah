    title: "א",
    info: `א (Aleph): Originally representing a glottal stop sound (/ʔ/), similar
        to the sound between the syllables of the English word "uh-oh". the
        letter Aleph also represents a vowel place holder when followed by
        either of the other vowels /a/ /o/ or /e/ in various positions within
        words. For example, in the word אור (or), meaning "light," the Aleph
        represents the vowel placeholder helping the waw create the "oh"
        sound. If the aleph was not present then this sound could not be
        achievable with the waw in the first letter position.`,
  },
  {
    title: "ו",
    info: `ו (Waw): While primarily a consonant representing the /w/ sound, the
        letter Waw can also represent the vowel sounds /o/ or /u/. In
        antiquity, the vowel is primarily an "Ō" sound, as in the word "coat."
        Over time, with the natural evolution of this vowel, we have the "U"
        sound, as in the word "noob." This evolution occurs naturally within
        speech and can cause the listener to perceive a shift from the natural
        "Ō" vowel. For instance, in the word "לרוץ" (la'rotz) meaning "to
        run," the Waw, represents the vowel /o/, but with natural evolution,
        this vowel may sound like the /u/ vowel.`,
  },
  {
    title: "י",
    info: `י (Yod): Besides functioning as a consonant representing the /y/
        sound, the letter Yod can indicate the vowel sounds /i/ or /e/. In
        words like בֵית (beith), meaning "house," the Yod represents the vowel
        /e/.`,

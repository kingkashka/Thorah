          (Thorah-Leviticus 11:1-2) “And YHWH spoke to Moshe and to Ahron,
          saying to them, speak to the sons of Yasharal saying this is the
          living creature which you will eat from all the hoofed animals which
          are upon the earth.” Bahemah (בהמה) = any hoofed animal that is
          classified in the clade as Euungulata "True ungulates". Ungulate is
          from the Late Latin adjective ungulatus, "hoofed". Ungulatus is a
          diminutive form of Latin unguis, "nail". “Whatever is dividing hoof,
          and is the one cleaving cleft hooves, the one causing to take up
          foliage, among the land animals, it will you all eat” (Torah-Leviticus
          11:3). Maprasath parasah (מפרסת פרסה) = the one dividing the hoof.
          Shasa'aghth shsagh parsath (שסעת שסע פרסת) = the one cleaving the
          cleft hoofs. Garah (גרה) = the leaves of a plant, collectively;
          leafage, foliage."

      <h2>animals that creep upon the earth</h2>
      <p>
        (Thorah-leviticus 11:27-28) “For all going upon its paws in all the
        animals which go upon four, unclean are they for you all, all who touch
        on their dead carcasses will be unclean until the sunset. And who
        carries their dead bodies will wash his clothes and be unclean until the
        sunset. they are unclean to you all.” The fifth category deals with
        non-flying terrestrial quadrupeds with paws such as cats, dogs,
        foxes,hedgehogs, wolves, lions, bears, lions, etc. They do not have
        human-like hands, or opposable thumbs or fingers, for grasping and
        vertical climbing. It is permissible to keep and to handle them as
        domesticated animals, but when they die they must not be touched and the
        one who has to touch them in order to remove them must wash his clothes
        and be unclean until the sunset.

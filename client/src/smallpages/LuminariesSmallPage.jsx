        Section III. Chapters LXXII-LXXXII The Book of the Heavenly Luminaries .
        [Chapter 72] 1 The book of the courses of the luminaries of the heaven,
        the relations of each, according to their classes, their dominion and
        their seasons, according to their names and places of origin, and
        according to their months, which Uriel, the holy angel, who was with me,
        who is their guide, showed me; and he showed me all their laws exactly
        as they are, and how it is with regard to all the years of the world 2
        and unto eternity, till the new creation is accomplished which dureth
        till eternity. And this is the first law of the luminaries: the luminary
        the Sun has its rising in the eastern portals of the heaven, 3 and its
        setting in the western portals of the heaven. And I saw six portals in
        which the sun rises, and six portals in which the sun sets and the moon
        rises and sets in these portals, and the leaders of the stars and those
        whom they lead: six in the east and six in the west, and all following
        each other 4 in accurately corresponding order: also many windows to the
        right and left of these portals. And first there goes forth the great
        luminary, named the Sun, and his circumference is like the 5
        circumference of the heaven, and he is quite filled with illuminating
        and heating fire. The chariot on which he ascends, the wind drives, and
        the sun goes down from the heaven and returns through the north in order
        to reach the east, and is so guided that he comes to the appropriate
        (lit. ' that ') portal and 6 shines in the face of the heaven. In this
        way he rises in the first month in the great portal, which 7 is the
        fourth [those six portals in the cast]. And in that fourth portal from
        which the sun rises in the first month are twelve window-openings, from
        which proceed a flame when they are opened in 8 their season. When the
        sun rises in the heaven, he comes forth through that fourth portal
        thirty, 9 mornings in succession, and sets accurately in the fourth
        portal in the west of the heaven. And during this period the day becomes
        daily longer and the night nightly shorter to the thirtieth 10 morning.
        On that day the day is longer than the night by a ninth part, and the
        day amounts exactly to ten parts and the night to eight parts. And the
        sun rises from that fourth portal, and sets in the fourth and returns to
        the fifth portal of the east thirty mornings, and rises from it and sets
        in the fifth 12 portal. And then the day becomes longer by two parts and
        amounts to eleven parts, and the night 13 becomes shorter and amounts to
        seven parts. And it returns to the east and enters into the sixth 14
        portal, and rises and sets in the sixth portal one-and-thirty mornings
        on account of its sign. On that day the day becomes longer than the
        night, and the day becomes double the night, and the day 15 becomes
        twelve parts, and the night is shortened and becomes six parts. And the
        sun mounts up to make the day shorter and the night longer, and the sun
        returns to the east and enters into the 16 sixth portal, and rises from
        it and sets thirty mornings. And when thirty mornings are accomplished,
        17 the day decreases by exactly one part, and becomes eleven parts, and
        the night seven. And the sun goes forth from that sixth portal in the
        west, and goes to the east and rises in the fifth portal for 18 thirty
        mornings, and sets in the west again in the fifth western portal. On
        that day the day decreases by two parts, and amounts to ten parts and
        the night to eight parts. And the sun goes forth from that fifth portal
        and sets in the fifth portal of the west, and rises in the fourth portal
        for one- 20 and-thirty mornings on account of its sign, and sets in the
        west. On that day the day is equalized with the night, [and becomes of
        equal length], and the night amounts to nine parts and the day to 21
        nine parts. And the sun rises from that portal and sets in the west, and
        returns to the east and rises 22 thirty mornings in the third portal and
        sets in the west in the third portal. And on that day the night becomes
        longer than the day, and night becomes longer than night, and day
        shorter than day till the thirtieth morning, and the night amounts
        exactly to ten parts and the day to eight 23 parts. And the sun rises
        from that third portal and sets in the third portal in the west and
        returns to the east, and for thirty mornings rises 24 in the second
        portal in the east, and in like manner sets in the second portal in the
        west of the heaven. And on that day the night amounts to eleven 25 parts
        and the day to seven parts. And the sun rises on that day from that
        second portal and sets in the west in the second portal, and returns to
        the east into the first portal for one-and-thirty 26 mornings, and sets
        in the first portal in the west of the heaven. And on that day the night
        becomes longer and amounts to the double of the day: and the night
        amounts exactly to twelve parts and 27 the day to six. And the sun has
        (therewith) traversed the divisions of his orbit and turns again on
        those divisions of his orbit, and enters that portal thirty mornings and
        sets also in the west 28 opposite to it. And on that night has the night
        decreased in length by a ninth part, and the night 29 has become eleven
        parts and the day seven parts. And the sun has returned and entered into
        the second portal in the east, and returns on those his divisions of his
        orbit for thirty mornings, rising 30 and setting. And on that day the
        night decreases in length, and the night amounts to ten parts 31 and the
        day to eight. And on that day the sun rises from that portal, and sets
        in the west, and returns to the east, and rises in the third portal for
        one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the west of the heaven. 32 On that
        day the night decreases and amounts to nine parts, and the day to nine
        parts, and the night 33 is equal to the day and the year is exactly as
        to its days three hundred and sixty-four. And the length of the day and
        of the night, and the shortness of the day and of the night
        arise-through the course 34 of the sun these distinctions are made (lit.
        ' they are separated '). So it comes that its course becomes 35 daily
        longer, and its course nightly shorter. And this is the law and the
        course of the sun, and his return as often as he returns sixty times and
        rises, i.e. the great luminary which is named the sun, for ever and
        ever. And that which (thus) rises is the great luminary, and is so named
        according to 37 its appearance, according as the Lord commanded. As he
        rises, so he sets and decreases not, and rests not, but runs day and
        night, and his light is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; but as
        regards size they are both equal. [Chapter 73] 1 And after this law I
        saw another law dealing with the smaller luminary, which is named the
        Moon. And her circumference is like the circumference of the heaven, and
        her chariot in which she rides is driven by the wind, and light is given
        to her in (definite) measure. And her rising and setting change every
        month: and her days are like the days of the sun, and when her light is
        uniform (i.e. full) it amounts to the seventh part of the light of the
        sun. And thus she rises. And her first phase in the east comes forth on
        the thirtieth morning: and on that day she becomes visible, and
        constitutes for you the first phase of the moon on the thirtieth day
        together with the sun in the portal where the sun rises. And the one
        half of her goes forth by a seventh part, and her whole circumference is
        empty, without light, with the exception of one-seventh part of it,
        (and) the 6 fourteenth part of her light. And when she receives
        one-seventh part of the half of her light, her light 7 amounts to
        one-seventh part and the half thereof. And she sets with the sun, and
        when the sun rises the moon rises with him and receives the half of one
        part of light, and in that night in the beginning of her morning [in the
        commencement of the lunar day] the moon sets with the sun, and 8 is
        invisible that night with the fourteen parts and the half of one of
        them. And she rises on that day with exactly a seventh part, and comes
        forth and recedes from the rising of the sun, and in her remaining days
        she becomes bright in the (remaining) thirteen parts. [Chapter 74] 1 And
        I saw another course, a law for her, (and) how according to that law she
        performs her monthly 2 revolution. And all these Uriel, the holy angel
        who is the leader of them all, showed to me, and their positions, and I
        wrote down their positions as he showed them to me, and I wrote down
        their months 3 as they were, and the appearance of their lights till
        fifteen days were accomplished. In single seventh parts she accomplishes
        all her light in the east, and in single seventh parts accomplishes all
        her 4 darkness in the west. And in certain months she alters her
        settings, and in certain months she pursues 5 her own peculiar course.
        In two months the moon sets with the sun: in those two middle portals
        the 6 third and the fourth. She goes forth for seven days, and turns
        about and returns again through the portal where the sun rises, and
        accomplishes all her light: and she recedes from the sun, and in eight 7
        days enters the sixth portal from which the sun goes forth. And when the
        sun goes forth from the fourth portal she goes forth seven days, until
        she goes forth from the fifth and turns back again in seven days into
        the fourth portal and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes and
        enters into the 8 first portal in eight days. And she returns again in
        seven days into the fourth portal from which the 9, 10 sun goes forth.
        Thus I saw their position -how the moons rose and the sun set in those
        days. And if five years are added together the sun has an overplus of
        thirty days, and all the days which accrue 11 to it for one of those
        five years, when they are full, amount to 364 days. And the overplus of
        the sun and of the stars amounts to six days: in 5 years 6 days every
        year come to 30 days: and the 12 moon falls behind the sun and stars to
        the number of 30 days. And the sun and the stars bring in all the years
        exactly, so that they do not advance or delay their position by a single
        day unto eternity; but complete the years with perfect justice in 364
        days. In 3 years there are 1,092 days, and in 5 years 1,820 days, so
        that in 8 years there are 2,912 days. For the moon alone the days amount
        in 3 years to 1,062 days, and in 5 years she falls 50 days behind: [i.e.
        to the sum (of 1,770) there is 5 to be added (1,000 and) 62 days.] And
        in 5 years there are 1,770 days, so that for the moon the days 6 in 8
        years amount to 21,832 days. [For in 8 years she falls behind to the
        amount of 80 days], all the 17 days she falls behind in 8 years are 80.
        And the year is accurately completed in conformity with their
        world-stations and the stations of the sun, which rise from the portals
        through which it (the sun) rises and sets 30 days. [Chapter 75] 1 And
        the leaders of the heads of the thousands, who are placed over the whole
        creation and over all the stars, have also to do with the four
        intercalary days, being inseparable from their office, according to the
        reckoning of the year, and these render service on the four days which
        are not 2 reckoned in the reckoning of the year. And owing to them men
        go wrong therein, for those luminaries truly render service on the
        world-stations, one in the first portal, one in the third portal of the
        heaven, one in the fourth portal, and one in the sixth portal, and the
        exactness of the year is 3 accomplished through its separate three
        hundred and sixty-four stations. For the signs and the times and the
        years and the days the angel Uriel showed to me, whom the Lord of glory
        hath set for ever over all the luminaries of the heaven, in the heaven
        and in the world, that they should rule on the face of the heaven and be
        seen on the earth, and be leaders for the day and the night, i.e. the
        sun, moon, and stars, and all the ministering creatures which make their
        revolution in all the chariots 4 of the heaven. In like manner twelve
        doors Uriel showed me, open in the circumference of the sun's chariot in
        the heaven, through which the rays of the sun break forth: and from them
        is warmth 5 diffused over the earth, when they are opened at their
        appointed seasons. [And for the winds and 6 the spirit of the dew when
        they are opened, standing open in the heavens at the ends.] As for the
        twelve portals in the heaven, at the ends of the earth, out of which go
        forth the sun, moon, and stars, 7 and all the works of heaven in the
        east and in the west, There are many windows open to the left and right
        of them, and one window at its (appointed) season produces warmth,
        corresponding (as these do) to those doors from which the stars come
        forth according as He has commanded them, 8 and wherein they set
        corresponding to their number. And I saw chariots in the heaven, running
        9 in the world, above those portals in which revolve the stars that
        never set. And one is larger than all the rest, and it is that that
        makes its course through the entire world. [Chapter 76] 1 And at the
        ends of the earth I saw twelve portals open to all the quarters (of the
        heaven), from 2 which the winds go forth and blow over the earth. Three
        of them are open on the face (i.e. the east) of the heavens, and three
        in the west, and three on the right (i.e. the south) of the heaven, and
        3 three on the left (i.e. the north). And the three first are those of
        the east, and three are of the 4 north, and three [after those on the
        left] of the south, and three of the west. Through four of these come
        winds of blessing and prosperity, and from those eight come hurtful
        winds: when they are sent, they bring destruction on all the earth and
        on the water upon it, and on all who dwell thereon, and on everything
        which is in the water and on the land. 5 And the first wind from those
        portals, called the east wind, comes forth through the first portal
        which is in the east, inclining towards the south: from it come forth
        desolation, drought, heat, 6 and destruction. And through the second
        portal in the middle comes what is fitting, and from it there come rain
        and fruitfulness and prosperity and dew; and through the third portal
        which lies toward the north come cold and drought. 7 And after these
        come forth the south winds through three portals: through the first
        portal of 8 them inclining to the east comes forth a hot wind. And
        through the middle portal next to it there 9 come forth fragrant smells,
        and dew and rain, and prosperity and health. And through the third
        portal lying to the west come forth dew and rain, locusts and
        desolation. 10 And after these the north winds: from the seventh portal
        in the east come dew and rain, locusts and desolation. And from the
        middle portal come in a direct direction health and rain and dew and
        prosperity; and through the third portal in the west come cloud and
        hoar-frost, and snow and rain, and dew and locusts. 12 And after these
        [four] are the west winds: through the first portal adjoining the north
        come forth dew and hoar-frost, and cold and snow and frost. And from the
        middle portal come forth dew and rain, and prosperity and blessing; and
        through the last portal which adjoins the south come forth drought and
        desolation, and burning and destruction. And the twelve portals of the
        four quarters of the heaven are therewith completed, and all their laws
        and all their plagues and all their benefactions have I shown to thee,
        my son Methuselah. [Chapter 77] 1 And the first quarter is called the
        east, because it is the first: and the second, the south, because the
        Most High will descend there, yea, there in quite a special sense will
        He who is blessed for ever 2 descend. And the west quarter is named the
        diminished, because there all the luminaries of the 3 heaven wane and go
        down. And the fourth quarter, named the north, is divided into three
        parts: the first of them is for the dwelling of men: and the second
        contains seas of water, and the abysses and forests and rivers, and
        darkness and clouds; and the third part contains the garden of
        righteousness. 4 I saw seven high mountains, higher than all the
        mountains which are on the earth: and thence 5 comes forth hoar-frost,
        and days, seasons, and years pass away. I saw seven rivers on the earth
        larger than all the rivers: one of them coming from the west pours its
        waters into the Great Sea. 6 And these two come from the north to the
        sea and pour their waters into the Erythraean Sea in the 7 east. And the
        remaining, four come forth on the side of the north to their own sea,
        two of them to the Erythraean Sea, and two into the Great Sea and
        discharge themselves there [and some say: 8 into the desert]. Seven
        great islands I saw in the sea and in the mainland: two in the mainland
        and five in the Great Sea. [Chapter 78] 1, 2 And the names of the sun
        are the following: the first Orjares, and the second Tomas. And the moon
        has four names: the first name is Asonja, the second Ebla, the third
        Benase, and the fourth 3 Erae. These are the two great luminaries: their
        circumference is like the circumference of the 4 heaven, and the size of
        the circumference of both is alike. In the circumference of the sun
        there are seven portions of light which are added to it more than to the
        moon, and in definite measures it is s transferred till the seventh
        portion of the sun is exhausted. And they set and enter the portals of
        the west, and make their revolution by the north, and come forth through
        the eastern portals 6 on the face of the heaven. And when the moon rises
        one-fourteenth part appears in the heaven: 7 [the light becomes full in
        her]: on the fourteenth day she accomplishes her light. And fifteen
        parts of light are transferred to her till the fifteenth day (when) her
        light is accomplished, according to the sign of the year, and she
        becomes fifteen parts, and the moon grows by (the addition of)
        fourteenth 8 parts. And in her waning (the moon) decreases on the first
        day to fourteen parts of her light, on the second to thirteen parts of
        light, on the third to twelve, on the fourth to eleven, on the fifth to
        ten, on the sixth to nine, on the seventh to eight, on the eighth to
        seven, on the ninth to six, on the tenth to five, on the eleventh to
        four, on the twelfth to three, on the thirteenth to two, on the 9
        fourteenth to the half of a seventh, and all her remaining light
        disappears wholly on the fifteenth. And 10 in certain months the month
        has twenty-nine days and once twenty-eight. And Uriel showed me another
        law: when light is transferred to the moon, and on which side it is
        transferred to her by the sun. During all the period during which the
        moon is growing in her light, she is transferring it to herself when
        opposite to the sun during fourteen days [her light is accomplished in
        the heaven, 12 and when she is illumined throughout, her light is
        accomplished full in the heaven. And on the first 13 day she is called
        the new moon, for on that day the light rises upon her. She becomes full
        moon exactly on the day when the sun sets in the west, and from the east
        she rises at night, and the moon shines the whole night through till the
        sun rises over against her and the moon is seen over against the sun. On
        the side whence the light of the moon comes forth, there again she wanes
        till all the light vanishes and all the days of the month are at an end,
        and her circumference is empty, void of 5 light. And three months she
        makes of thirty days, and at her time she makes three months of twenty-
        nine days each, in which she accomplishes her waning in the first period
        of time, and in the first 6 portal for one hundred and seventy-seven
        days. And in the time of her going out she appears for three months (of)
        thirty days each, and for three months she appears (of) twenty-nine
        each. At night she appears like a man for twenty days each time, and by
        day she appears like the heaven, and there is nothing else in her save
        her light. [Chapter 79] 1 And now, my son, I have shown thee everything,
        and the law of all the stars of the heaven is 2 completed. And he showed
        me all the laws of these for every day, and for every season of bearing
        rule, and for every year, and for its going forth, and for the order
        prescribed to it every month 3 and every week: And the waning of the
        moon which takes place in the sixth portal: for in this 4 sixth portal
        her light is accomplished, and after that there is the beginning of the
        waning: (And the waning) which takes place in the first portal in its
        season, till one hundred and seventy-seven 5 days are accomplished:
        reckoned according to weeks, twenty-five (weeks) and two days. She falls
        behind the sun and the order of the stars exactly five days in the
        course of one period, and when 6 this place which thou seest has been
        traversed. Such is the picture and sketch of every luminary which Uriel
        the archangel, who is their leader, showed unto me. [Chapter 80] 1 And
        in those days the angel Uriel answered and said to me: ' Behold, I have
        shown thee everything, Enoch, and I have revealed everything to thee
        that thou shouldst see this sun and this moon, and the leaders of the
        stars of the heaven and all those who turn them, their tasks and times
        and departures. 2 And in the days of the sinners the years shall be
        shortened, And their seed shall be tardy on their lands and fields, And
        all things on the earth shall alter, And shall not appear in their time:
        And the rain shall be kept back And the heaven shall withhold (it). 3
        And in those times the fruits of the earth shall be backward, And shall
        not grow in their time, And the fruits of the trees shall be withheld in
        their time. 4 And the moon shall alter her order, And not appear at her
        time. 5 [And in those days the sun shall be seen and he shall journey in
        the evening on the extremity of the great chariot in the west] And shall
        shine more brightly than accords with the order of light. 6 And many
        chiefs of the stars shall transgress the order (prescribed). And these
        shall alter their orbits and tasks, And not appear at the seasons
        prescribed to them. 7 And the whole order of the stars shall be
        concealed from the sinners, And the thoughts of those on the earth shall
        err concerning them, [And they shall be altered from all their ways],
        Yea, they shall err and take them to be gods. 8 And evil shall be
        multiplied upon them, And punishment shall come upon them So as to
        destroy all.' [Chapter 81] 1 And he said unto me: ' Observe, Enoch,
        these heavenly tablets, And read what is written thereon, And mark every
        individual fact.' 2 And I observed the heavenly tablets, and read
        everything which was written (thereon) and understood everything, and
        read the book of all the deeds of mankind, and of all the children of
        flesh 3 that shall be upon the earth to the remotest generations. And
        forthwith I blessed the great Lord the King of glory for ever, in that
        He has made all the works of the world, And I extolled the Lord because
        of His patience, And blessed Him because of the children of men. 4 And
        after that I said: ' Blessed is the man who dies in righteousness and
        goodness, Concerning whom there is no book of unrighteousness written,
        And against whom no day of judgement shall be found.' 5 And those seven
        holy ones brought me and placed me on the earth before the door of my
        house, and said to me: ' Declare everything to thy son Methuselah, and
        show to all thy children that no 6 flesh is righteous in the sight of
        the Lord, for He is their Creator. One year we will leave thee with thy
        son, till thou givest thy (last) commands, that thou mayest teach thy
        children and record (it) for them, and testify to all thy children; and
        in the second year they shall take thee from their midst. 7 Let thy
        heart be strong, For the good shall announce righteousness to the good;
        The righteous with the righteous shall rejoice, And shall offer
        congratulation to one another. 8 But the sinners shall die with the
        sinners, And the apostate go down with the apostate. 9 And those who
        practice righteousness shall die on account of the deeds of men, And be
        taken away on account of the doings of the godless.' 10 And in those
        days they ceased to speak to me, and I came to my people, blessing the
        Lord of the world. [Chapter 82] 1 And now, my son Methuselah, all these
        things I am recounting to thee and writing down for thee! and I have
        revealed to thee everything, and given thee books concerning all these:
        so preserve, my son Methuselah, the books from thy father's hand, and
        (see) that thou deliver them to the generations of the world. 2 I have
        given Wisdom to thee and to thy children, [And thy children that shall
        be to thee], That they may give it to their children for generations,
        This wisdom (namely) that passeth their thought. 3 And those who
        understand it shall not sleep, But shall listen with the ear that they
        may learn this wisdom, And it shall please those that eat thereof better
        than good food. 4 Blessed are all the righteous, blessed are all those
        who walk In the way of righteousness and sin not as the sinners, in the
        reckoning of all their days in which the sun traverses the heaven,
        entering into and departing from the portals for thirty days with the
        heads of thousands of the order of the stars, together with the four
        which are intercalated which divide the four portions of the year, which
        5 lead them and enter with them four days. Owing to them men shall be at
        fault and not reckon them in the whole reckoning of the year: yea, men
        shall be at fault, and not recognize them 6 accurately. For they belong
        to the reckoning of the year and are truly recorded (thereon) for ever,
        one in the first portal and one in the third, and one in the fourth and
        one in the sixth, and the year is completed in three hundred and
        sixty-four days. 7 And the account thereof is accurate and the recorded
        reckoning thereof exact; for the luminaries, and months and festivals,
        and years and days, has Uriel shown and revealed to me, to whom the 8
        Lord of the whole creation of the world hath subjected the host of
        heaven. And he has power over night and day in the heaven to cause the
        light to give light to men -sun, moon, and stars, 9 and all the powers
        of the heaven which revolve in their circular chariots. And these are
        the orders of the stars, which set in their places, and in their seasons
        and festivals and months. 10 And these are the names of those who lead
        them, who watch that they enter at their times, in their orders, in
        their seasons, in their months, in their periods of dominion, and in
        their positions. Their four leaders who divide the four parts of the
        year enter first; and after them the twelve leaders of the orders who
        divide the months; and for the three hundred and sixty (days) there are
        heads over thousands who divide the days; and for the four intercalary
        days there are the leaders which sunder 12 the four parts of the year.
        And these heads over thousands are intercalated between 13 leader and
        leader, each behind a station, but their leaders make the division. And
        these are the names of the leaders who divide the four parts of the year
        which are ordained: Milki'el, Hel'emmelek, and Mel'ejal, 14 and Narel.
        And the names of those who lead them: Adnar'el, and Ijasusa'el, and
        'Elome'el- these three follow the leaders of the orders, and there is
        one that follows the three leaders of the orders which follow those
        leaders of stations that divide the four parts of the year. In the
        beginning of the year Melkejal rises first and rules, who is named
        Tam'aini and sun, and 16 all the days of his dominion whilst he bears
        rule are ninety-one days. And these are the signs of the days which are
        to be seen on earth in the days of his dominion: sweat, and heat, and
        calms; and all the trees bear fruit, and leaves are produced on all the
        trees, and the harvest of wheat, and the rose-flowers, and all the
        flowers which come forth in the field, but the trees of the winter
        season become withered. And these are the names of the leaders which are
        under them: Berka'el, Zelebs'el, and another who is added a head of a
        thousand, called Hilujaseph: and the days of the dominion of this
        (leader) are at an end. 18 The next leader after him is Hel'emmelek,
        whom one names the shining sun, and all the days 19 of his light are
        ninety-one days. And these are the signs of (his) days on the earth:
        glowing heat and dryness, and the trees ripen their fruits and produce
        all their fruits ripe and ready, and the sheep pair and become pregnant,
        and all the fruits of the earth are gathered in, and everything that is
        20 in the fields, and the winepress: these things take place in the days
        of his dominion. These are the names, and the orders, and the leaders of
        those heads of thousands: Gida'ljal, Ke'el, and He'el, and the name of
        the head of a thousand which is added to them, Asfa'el: and the days of
        his dominion are at an end.
